## Chess Laravel

---

Set up to use a [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) backend and a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) frontend,
glued together with [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/) and compiled by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

This is not meant to be a fully functional and proper Chess game application; at least for the time being,
this is just an application developed for learning and testing purposes (and for fun).
